Collaborative maps
##################

This project is the simple implementation of a need we had as a group of
people: we wanted to have a way, for multiple unknown users, to submit events,
with locations and simple locations, to contribute to a global map.

The map has to provide filters so it is possible to select which kind of
information shows up, as well as more precise information about the points when
clicking on it.

This is as simple as it sound. I've made it a django application so I'm able to
re-learn how to do django apps :)
